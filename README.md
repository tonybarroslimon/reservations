This is the beginning of our reservation system in Django

The system is comprised of several apps:

1. A contacts app that allows you to make groups and send them out.
2. An events app that allows you to make events and quickly update an events calendar on your website
3. A "make" app which is the app that allows you to make reservations.
4. A menu app that allows for dynamic menus to be implemented into a website
5. An Online_orders app which allows you to make orders online.
6. A rewards app which allows you to create a customer loyalty/rewards programs.

What is done and what still needs to be done

1. The models.py file is done for all apps. None of the logic in the views.py file is complete.
2. None of the URL routing is complete.
3. None of the front end work is done, either for a web based template or an app based template.

Functionality that still needs to be created:

1. A way to manage scheduling
2. A way to manage Payroll
3. A way to manage bookkeeping
4. A way to manage Inventory
